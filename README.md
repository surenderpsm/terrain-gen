# Procedural Terrain Generator
A real-time terrain generation demo using C++ and OpenGL.
This project visualizes large-scale, procedurally generated landscapes using Perlin noise and fractal algorithms. Features include:

 - Heightmap-based terrain mesh generation
 - Real-time rendering with OpenGL (GLFW + GLAD)
 - Basic camera movement (WASD + mouse)
 - Optional wireframe/debug modes
 - Designed for performance and scalability
